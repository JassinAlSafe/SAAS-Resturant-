# Notes Feature with Supabase Integration

## Description

This PR adds a comprehensive notes and communication system to the restaurant inventory management application, fully integrated with Supabase. The feature allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes with tagging functionality, filtering, and categorization.

## Changes Made

1. Created Supabase integration for notes and tags management
2. Added SQL migrations for creating required tables with proper RLS policies
3. Implemented seed data scripts for initial tag setup
4. Created a service layer for interacting with Supabase
5. Updated the notes page to use the Supabase-backed service
6. Added comprehensive documentation for setup and usage

## Setup Required

Follow the instructions in the `NOTES_SETUP.md` file to:

1. Run the database migrations
2. Set up seed data (optional)
3. Configure the frontend to use Supabase

## Testing

- [ ] Verify notes creation works with proper business profile scoping
- [ ] Test that tags are correctly saved and associated with notes
- [ ] Confirm filtering and search functionality works as expected
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling for edge cases
- [ ] Verify that RLS policies correctly prevent unauthorized access

## Additional Notes

The implementation includes a fallback to mock data for development purposes. To use it, simply import from `notes-service.ts` instead of `notes-service-supabase.ts`.
