# Shopping List Feature

## Overview

The shopping list feature is a core component of our restaurant inventory system, designed to efficiently manage and track shopping lists for restaurant supplies. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing inventory purchases, from planning to execution.

## UX Improvements

We've implemented several UX improvements to enhance the user experience:

1. **Task Completion Flow**: Step-by-step shopping wizard with visual progress indicators to guide users through the shopping process.

2. **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Information is organized into tabs to reduce cognitive load. Related functions are grouped together for easier discovery.

3. **User Context Adaptation**: Role-based views for different staff roles (chef, manager, staff) to show relevant information.

4. **Error Prevention**: Proper form validations with visual cues, and confirmation dialogues for destructive actions.

5. **Recovery Options**: "Undo" functionality for accidental actions and clear toast notifications for state changes.

6. **Accessibility Features**: Robust keyboard navigation, screen reader optimizations, and ARIA attributes for better accessibility.

7. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications and visual indicators for state changes and process completions.

8. **Data Visualization**: Charts for spending analysis and shopping progress to visualize important metrics.

9. **Information Architecture**: Improved organization of metrics and data to create a clearer hierarchy.

10. **Cross-Device Experience**: Responsive design optimizations for mobile, tablet, and desktop experiences.
